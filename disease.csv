Rabies (Inf. by Rabies virus);Viral;Rabies is a viral disease that affects mammals, including humans. It is transmitted through the bite of an infected animal and can cause neurological symptoms, leading to death if left untreated.
Infection with Bonamia ostreae;Protozoan;Bonamia ostreae is a protozoan parasite that infects oysters. It can cause mortality in affected oyster populations and has implications for oyster farming and fisheries.
Aujeszky's disease;Viral;Aujeszky's disease, also known as pseudorabies, is a viral disease that primarily affects pigs. It can also infect other animals, causing respiratory and neurological symptoms.
Equine infectious anaemia;Viral;Equine infectious anaemia is a viral disease that affects horses and other equines. It can cause anemia, fever, and a range of clinical signs, and is of significant concern for the equine industry.
Brucella abortus (Inf. by);Bacterial;Brucella abortus is a bacterial species that causes brucellosis in cattle. It can also infect other animals and humans, causing flu-like symptoms and potential long-term complications.
Anthrax;Bacterial;Anthrax is a bacterial disease that affects both animals and humans. It can cause severe illness and death and is primarily transmitted through contact with contaminated animal products or spores.
Brucella suis (Inf. by);Bacterial;Brucella suis is a bacterial species that causes brucellosis in pigs. It can also infect other animals and humans, causing flu-like symptoms and potential long-term complications.
Epizootic haemorrhagic disease;Viral;Epizootic haemorrhagic disease is a viral disease that primarily affects deer and other ruminants. It can cause fever, hemorrhage, and high mortality rates in affected populations.
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Captive Poultry;Viral;Highly pathogenic avian influenza is a viral disease that affects captive poultry, including chickens and turkeys. It can cause severe respiratory illness, high mortality rates, and has the potential for zoonotic transmission.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Inf. by the complex);Bacterial;Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex refers to a group of bacteria that cause tuberculosis in various species, including humans and animals.
Sheep pox and goat pox;Viral;Sheep pox and goat pox are viral diseases that affect sheep and goats, respectively. They can cause fever, skin lesions, and significant economic losses in affected livestock populations.
